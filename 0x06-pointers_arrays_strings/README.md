0-strcat.c A function that concatenates two strings. It appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, 
and then adds a terminating null byteReturns a pointer to the resulting string dest. FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat.

1-strncat.c A function that concatenates two strings. It will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. It returns a pointer to the resulting string dest. FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat.

2-strncpy.c A function that works exactly like strncpy FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. 

3-strcmp.c A function that works exactly like strcmp. FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcmp.

4-rev_array.c A function that reverses the content of an array of integers. n is the number of elements of the array.

5-string_toupper.c A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.


6-cap_string.c A function that capitalizes all words of a string. My separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }.

7-leet.c A function that encodes a string into 1337.I'm limited to 1 prototype and 2 loops in my code,without using switch and any ternary operation.

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1.

100-rot13.c A function that encodes a string using rot13.I'm limited to 1 if statement and 2 loops in my code.
No using switch statement or any ternary operation.

101-print_number.c A function that prints an integer. I can only use _putchar function to print.
No using long,arrays or pointers nor hard-code special values.

102-magic.c Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line using one statement. No using the variable a in the new line of code, modifying the variable p, using ,
(comma),the standard library nor code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line. The code should be written at line 19, before the ; No removing anything from
the initial code (not even the comments) and donâ€™t change anything but the line of code I add (no changing the spaces to tabs!)
